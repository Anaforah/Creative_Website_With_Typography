                <h2>Graphic Design: The new Basics</h2>
                <p>Color can convey a mood, describe reality, or codify information. Words like "gloomy," "drab," and
                    "glittering" each bring to mind a general climate of colors, a palette of relationships. Designers
                    use color to make some things <strong class="InteractWord" id="e1">stand out</strong> (warning signs) and to make other things
                     <strong class="InteractWord" id="e2">disappear</strong>
                    (camouflage). Color serves to differentiate and connect, to highlight and to hide.<br><br>
                    Graphic design was once seen as a fundamentally black-and-white enterprise. This is no longer
                    the case. Color has become integral to the design process. Color printing, once a luxury, has
                    become routine.<br><br>
                    An infinite range of <strong class="InteractWord" id="e3">hues and intensities</strong> bring modern media to life, energizing the page, the
screen, and the built environment with sensuality and significance. Graphics and color have
converged. […] Color exists, literally, in the eye of the beholder. We cannot perceive color until
light bounces off an object or is emitted from a source and enters the eye. Our perception of color
depends not solely on the pigmentation of physical surfaces, but also on the brightness and
character of ambient light.
<br><br>
In 1665 Sir Isaac Newton discovered that a prism separates light into the <strong class="InteractWord" id="e4">spectrum</strong> of colors: <strong id="e5">red</strong>,
<strong id="e6">orange</strong>, <strong id="e7">yellow</strong>, <strong id="e8">green</strong>, <strong id="e9">blue</strong>, <strong id="e10">indigo</strong>, and <strong id="e11">violet</strong>. He organized the colors around a wheel very much
like the one artists use today to describe the relationships among colors.[…] Why is the color
wheel a useful design tool? Colors that sit near each other on the spectrum or close together on
the color wheel are analogous. Using them together provides minimal color contrast and an innate
harmony, because each color has some element in common with others in the sequence. […]
<br><br>
<strong class="InteractWord" id="e12">CYMK</strong> is used in the printing process. While painters use the basic color wheel as a guide for
mixing paint, printing ink uses a different set of colors: <strong id="e13">cyan</strong>, <strong id="e14">magenta</strong>,
 <strong id="e15">yellow</strong>, and <strong id="e16">black</strong>, which
are ideal for reproducing the range of colors found in color photographs. In principle, C, M, and Y
should produce black, but the resulting mix is not rich enough to reproduce color images with a
full tonal range. […]
<br><br>
<strong class="InteractWord" id="e17">RGB</strong> is the additive system used for designing on screen. Different percentages of <strong id="e18">red</strong>, <strong id="e19">green</strong>, and
<strong id="e20">blue</strong> light combine to generate the colors of the spectrum. White occurs when all three colors are
at full strength. Black occurs when zero light (and thus zero color) is emitted.[…]
<br><br>
[…] Designers juxtapose colors to create specific climates and qualities, using one color to
diminish or intensify another. Understanding how colors interact helps designers control the
power of color and systematically test variations of an idea.

                <h2>Color: My Perspective</h2>
                <p>
                    I was drawn to this text because of the profound emotions that colors evoke me.
                    They possess an innate ability to exude energy and enthusiasm, even in the absence
                     of accompanying text. For example, a simple homepage adorned with a vibrant background 
                     color disrupts the monotony of emptiness, injecting life into the void, even if it 
                     lacks substantive content. <br><br>In my view, colors have the remarkable power to infuse 
                     any design project with a sense of natural vibrancy, simplifying information in a 
                     visually accessible manner, that's why in my point of view I consider colors an 
                     important principle in Design.<br>
